# Include an inventory of sensors and the appropriate vars. You can configure the 
#   manager ip and manager key here if you want them to be unique to each device,
#   or you can include them in the global vars if they are common to all devices.
# <Hostname or IP> <manager_ip=> <manager_key=>
# You should populate your devices here, and any individual vars.
#  It would be better to use the group vars vs individual vars unless
#  you have a one-off system.
