# Automate-FirePower
Cisco FirePower, lets face it, isn't a great platform to work with. It relies on custom perl scripts to configure the system with a clunky and limited clish shell by default which can make deploying, hardening, and managing these systems a nightmare. To alieviate the pain, this is an in the works project to automate Cisco Firepower vm deployment to the nth degree.
